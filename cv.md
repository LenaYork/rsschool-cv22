I've always been interested in computer science and now that I'm adult I'd like to finaly follow this desire of mine.
Having been teaching English for many years I've realized how important the language is when it comes to learning, especially learning programming. Knowing the language helps me a lot since there're so many decent courses and videos in English. I love the process of coding and finding solutions. My enthusiasm, willing to learn new things and hopefully theoretical knowledge will help make my lack of experience a temporary thing.

I have been making websites with the help of Wordpress CMS for a couple of years (online shops mostly). I've also been a part-time system administrator in a Minsk Gestalt Institute for more than a year.

Speaking about skills, I have been using:

- [x] javascript
- [x] html 
- [x] css 

mostly with such libraries as bootstrap and jQuery. 
I have used ReactJS for making SPA.
I also have basic knowledge of PHP and SQL.

The VCS I've been using is Git.
The CMS I've been using is Wordpress.

Here you can have a look at my code example:
[Horoscope](https://github.com/LenaYork/horoscope)
[Learn English words](https://github.com/LenaYork/Cubs)
[Clock](https://github.com/LenaYork/Clock)
[Teacher Webpage](https://github.com/LenaYork/English-Teacher)
[Caller ID](https://github.com/LenaYork/Caller-ID)

Here is a short code example:
```javascript
    rootDiv.appendChild(explanation);

    const form = document.createElement('form');
    form.setAttribute('method', 'post');
    rootDiv.appendChild(form);

    let signList = document.createElement('select');
    signList.setAttribute('id', 'select');
    form.appendChild(signList);

    signs.map( (elem, i) => {
    let newOption = document.createElement('option');
    newOption.setAttribute('value', elem);
    newOption.innerText = signDates[i];
    signList.appendChild(newOption);
    });
```

My coding experience includes:
1. Adding markup and script to websites 
2. Creating online-shops using Wordpress, JavaScript and PHP
3. Making simple games and webpages as a part of my self-education.

Here are some examples (the code of each one can be seen in code example part above):
